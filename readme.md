# Wordle Solver Bot

### Context
Wordle is a daily word game created by Josh Wardle, a Brooklyn-based software engineer who has developed something of a reputation as a crafter of interesting social experiments. Every day, the people of the internet are greeted with a fresh word puzzle that can only be solved â€” or not!

### What is this project about?

We are working on a Wordle Solving algorithm to guess a word in minimum number of moves. We are also working on creating a connector to the Wordle official site so that we don't have type out the words. All we have to do is run the project and watch everything happen!

### Running the project

You can import the project (Projects from Git option in Eclipse) using the Clone URI option. Once cloned, this run the `main.java`.
